          <h3> Save trees </h3>
          <p> The tree provides us with oxygen and makes our life possible on earth. Trees consume the carbon dioxide and provide us with food, shelter, home, money, medicines, and what not. Trees are also the source of rain for us as they attract clouds. Trees help in preventing pollution and keeps the environment fresh </p>

              <h3> Save animals </h3>
              <p> For maintaining a healthy ecological balance on this earth, animals, plants and marine species are as important as humans. Each organism on this earth has a unique place in food chain that helps contribute to the ecosystem in its own special way. But, sadly today, many of the animals and birds are getting endangered </p>
